# MSDesGAT
 Multi-Scale Dense Graph Attention net- work (MSDesGAT) for hyperspectral classification
In recent years, several Deep learning-based methods have attracted more and more attention in hyperspectral classification, especially Graph Neural Network (GNN), which has better capabilities for structure description. However, single scale graph structure isnâ€™t suitable for hyperspectral feature representation. Thus, we propose a novel mulit-scale graph network structure, i.e. Multi-Scale Dense Graph Attention network (MSDesGAT) for hyperspectral classification. Firstly, Semi-supervised local Fisher discriminant analysis (SELF) and super-pixel segmentation are employed for dimensionality reduction and multi-scale graph construction, respectively. Secondly an
improved graph self-attention network is sequentially applied for each scale graph. And then different scale graphs are densely connected by designed twice matrix multiplication. Finally multi-scale features can be derived and fusion with pixel-level feature for hyperspectral classification. Experimental results on three hyperspectral data sets show that our MSDesGAT outperforms many state-of-the-art methods.
